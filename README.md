# Final-Project-
My project will analyze crime trends in Chicago using publicly available crime data. My goal is to explore patterns in crime based on time, location, and type of crime. My project will provides statistical insights and visual representations to help understand crime trends in different areas.
The project consists of three core functions:

load_and_clean_data(file_path)

Loads the Chicago crime dataset from a CSV file.
Cleans missing data and formats the date column for better analysis.
generate_statistics(df)

Computes crime trends, including total crimes per year and crime types.
Displays crime distribution over time.
visualize_data(df)

Generates visualizations (graphs and charts) to display crime patterns.
Uses matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
